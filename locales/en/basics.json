			"*bool:* logical type. It can take one of two values - _​True_ and _False_. The size of the occupied memory for this type is not precisely defined.",
			"*char:* represents a single ASCII character. It occupies `1 byte` (8 bits) in memory. Can store any value from `-128` to `127`, or `0` to `255`.",
			"*signed char:* represents one character. It occupies `1 byte` (8 bits) in memory. Can store any value from `-128` to `127`.",
			"*unsigned char:* represents one character. It occupies `1 byte` (8 bits) in memory. Can store any value from `0` to `255`.",
			"*wchar_t:* represents a wide character. On Windows it occupies `2` bytes (16 bits) in memory, on Linux it takes `4` bytes (32 bits). Can store any value from `0` to `65,535` (for 2 bytes), or `0` to `4,294,967,295` (for 4 bytes).",

			"*int:* represents an integer number. Depending on the architecture of the processor, it may occupy '2' bytes (16 bits) or '4' bytes (32 bits).

But in any case, the size must be greater than or equal to the size of the short type and less than or equal to the size of the long type. This type is synonymous with *signed int* and *signed*.",
			"*unsigned int:* represents a positive integer. It can occupy '2' bytes (16 bits) or '4' bytes (32 bits) depending on the architecture of the processor, and because of this the range of limit values can vary: from '0' to '65535' (for 2 bytes), or from '0' to '4 294 967 295' (for 4 bytes). As a synonym of this type *unsigned* can be used.",

			"*unsigned long long:* represents an integer between '0' and '18,446,744,073,709,551,615'. Usually takes up '8' bytes (64 bits) of memory. It is synonymous with *unsigned long long int*.",
			"*float:* represents a floating-point floating-point real number between '+/- 3.4E-38' and '3.4E+38'. Takes up '4' bytes (32 bits) in memory.",
			"*double:* represents a double-precision floating-point real number in the range '+/- 1.7E-308' to '1.7E+308'. It occupies '8' bytes (64 bits) in memory.",
			"*long double:* represents a double-precision floating-point real number of at least '8' bytes (64 bits). The range of valid values may differ depending on the size of the memory occupied.",
			"*void:* type without value.",
			"Thus, all data types except void can be divided into three groups: character (char, wchar_t, char16_t, char32_t), integer (short, int, long, long long) and floating-point number types (float, double, long double)."
